# [Super Secure Password Generator](https://ovni.pw)

This is a website that generates very secure passwords without storing them anywhere. Use a system of seeds and hashes to generate a unique password depending on a master password and a word or phrase that you add for each service or website.

The original idea is from [@pagoru](https://github.com/pagoru/sss.pagoru.es).

### Usage

Make sure to install [Deno](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation)

Then start the project:

```
deno task dev
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
